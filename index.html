        <div class="bio center">
          <p>I started back in Mexico, working with car parts in a workshop. After coming to the US in 1986 I thought to myself <span>"Why not work with bicycles?"</span></p><img src="../img/juan.jpg"/>
          <p>At first I was working with a company fixing and assembling bicycle wheels. I would spend hours working on them, sometimes up to 1000 in a day.</p>
          <p>As time passed, I wanted to learn more about bicycles and started fixing them in my basement. Years passed and people always asked me: <span>"Why don't you open up your own shop?", "You can fix bikes and you have your own parts."</span></p>
          <p>Eventually, I opened up a small shop and named it <strong>"El Frondoso"</strong> a nickname given to me when I was young. My son and daughter work with me, a true family owned business was created.</p>

          <div class="bio"><img src="../img/jorge.jpg"/>
            <p> <strong>Jorge</strong> is the one person you would normally find in the shop by himself. Usually on his phone learning how to fix certain things or how to use a tool. He's very smart and a mechanic in his own right.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="bio"><img src="../img/monica.jpg"/>
            <p> <strong>Monica </strong> is the "secretary" of the shop. She's usually the girl that is either looking on her laptop or in a catalog, searching for updates or new pieces or tools the shop needs. Not much of a mechanic herself, she can definitely hold her own in a bicycle related conversation.</p>
